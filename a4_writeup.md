# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
    The has won. Checking for the possible winning states was annoyng and surrprisinly hard. 

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
    I would like to add AI with a little bit of randimization, but my current thought would to be to play only the smartest moves, wich is anoying to code but not to much to code.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
    Well, the best response is always either the middle or a corner for thefirst move, so since the best moves are simple, I would code the response wiht if else statments as what move for the computer to make.
